# MSc-program-final
This MSc program is called Last 10 metres travel aid for blind people.
This is a group program.
My part is to design and build a blind walking assistance system that can use the mobile phone camera to identify obstacles and plan paths in real time.
The system can idenfy several tyes of obstacles, estimate obstacle distance, and provide avoidance strategies.
The system have a front end and a beck end. The front end is a Flutter based mobile software. It use Dart program language. The back end is a Python Flask web server. It use Tensorflow model and OpenCv to modify image which camera captured and identify the obstacels.
The backend can be deployed on the cloud or locally on the mobile phone. Use HTTP to transfer data, and use JSON format data.
The pip list as follow:
pip list h5py 3.1.0 keras 2.6.0 matplotlib 3.6.0 numpy 1.19.2 opencv-python 4.8.0.74 Pillow 9.4.0 PyQt5 5.15.7 QtPy 2.2.0 scipy 1.6.2 tensorflow 2.6.0 tqdm 4.64.1
